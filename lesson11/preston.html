                <h3>Facts and fiction about the northern lights</h3>
                <h4>Many are fascinated by the aurora borealis, but few know the science and myths related to the
                    natural light
                    show in the sky.</h4>

                    When you get the aurora borealis explained by advanced physicists who specialize in the field of magnetohydrodynamics, it can be hard to see the link to the lights that dance spontaneously and like crazy above your head.<br><br>

                    But the phenomenon can also be explained in a tangible way: We have the sun to thank for everything, also the auroras, and during large solar explosions and flares, huge quantities of particles are thrown out from the sun and into deep space.<br><br>
                    
                    <h4>The maths of the northern lights</h4>
                    Here’s where it gets really interesting: When the particles meet the Earth’s magnetic shield, they are led towards an oval around the magnetic North Pole where they interact with the upper parts of the atmosphere, the layers of ozone, oxygen, and other stuff that protect the earth. The energy which is then released is sent to us as northern lights.<br><br>
                    
                    It adds to the magic to know that this performance happens approximately 62 miles above our heads. Its immense power is the reason why we can see it so clearly, as it’s helped by a myriad of atoms and molecules.<br><br>
                    
                    But never take the northern lights for granted. It’s as much a natural phenomenon as the weather. Its appearance and intensity are controlled by the sun’s activity and its location depends on the earth’s magnetic field.<br><br>
                    
                    The northern light appears in a belt, or an oval, which is situated above the Earth in a regular position in relation to the sun. The lights will usually be visible over mainland Northern Norway during the night and over Svalbard during the daytime. When solar activity increases, the northern lights can also be seen further south in Norway.<br><br>
