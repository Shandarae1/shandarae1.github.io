        <h3>Facts and fiction about the northern lights</h3>
        <h4>Many are fascinated by the aurora borealis, but few know the science and myths related to the natural light
          show in the sky.</h4>
        Source: NordNorsk Reiseliv <br><br>

        When you get the aurora borealis explained by advanced physicists who specialize in the field of
        magnetohydrodynamics, it can be hard to see the link to the lights that dance spontaneously and like crazy above
        your head.<br><br>

        But the phenomenon can also be explained in a tangible way: We have the sun to thank for everything, also the
        auroras, and during large solar explosions and flares, huge quantities of particles are thrown out from the sun
        and into deep space.<br><br>

        The maths of the northern lights
        Here’s where it gets really interesting: When the particles meet the Earth’s magnetic shield, they are led
        towards an oval around the magnetic North Pole where they interact with the upper parts of the atmosphere, the
        layers of ozone, oxygen, and other stuff that protect the earth. The energy which is then released is sent to us
        as northern lights.<br><br>

        It adds to the magic to know that this performance happens approximately 62 miles above our heads. Its immense
        power is the reason why we can see it so clearly, as it’s helped by a myriad of atoms and molecules.<br><br>

        But never take the northern lights for granted. It’s as much a natural phenomenon as the weather. Its appearance
        and intensity are controlled by the sun’s activity and its location depends on the earth’s magnetic
        field.<br><br>

        The northern light appears in a belt, or an oval, which is situated above the Earth in a regular position in
        relation to the sun. The lights will usually be visible over mainland Northern Norway during the night and over
        Svalbard during the daytime. When solar activity increases, the northern lights can also be seen further south
        in Norway.Aurora borealis is far from a new phenomenon. The spectacle of the northern lights is described by
        early storytellers and has given rise to many legends. Symbols linked to the northern lights are for instance
        found on the Sami shamanistic drum. The phenomenon has several different names in Sami, amongst them
        “Guovssahas” which means “the light which can be heard”. It’s poetry in motion.<br><br>

        During the Viking Age, the northern lights were said to be the armor of the Valkyrie warrior virgins, that shed
        a strange flickering light. Today, locals are often respectfully referring to the northern lights as “the green
        lady”. Just check the colors in the numerous photos and films of the lights posted on social media. You might
        see many more nuances in real life, though. <a
